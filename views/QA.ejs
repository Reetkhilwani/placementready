    <h2>Time and Distance</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Two cities A and B are 60 km apart. Two bikes start from A and B in opposite directions at 40 km/hr and 20 km/hr. When will they meet?</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Relative speed = 40 + 20 = 60 km/hr</p>
            <p>Time to meet = Distance / Speed = 60 / 60 = 1 hour</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> A train of length 300m crosses a pole in 15 seconds. What is its speed in km/hr?</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Speed = Distance / Time = 300 / 15 = 20 m/s</p>
            <p>Convert to km/hr: 20 × 18/5 = 72 km/hr</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> A man walking at 5 km/hr reaches his destination 15 minutes late. If he walks at 7 km/hr, he reaches 5 minutes early. What is the actual distance?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Let the actual time taken be <b>t</b> hours.</p>
        <p>Using the given conditions:</p>
        <p><b>d / 5 = t + (15/60)</b></p>
        <p><b>d / 7 = t - (5/60)</b></p>
        <p>Solving both equations, we get:</p>
        <p><b>d = 7 km</b></p>
        <p>Answer: <b>7 km</b></p>
    </div>
    <h2>Time and Work</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> A can do a piece of work in 8 days, and B can do it in 12 days. How long will they take to complete it together?</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>A's 1-day work = 1/8, B's 1-day work = 1/12</p>
            <p>(1/8 + 1/12) = 5/24</p>
            <p>Time = 24/5 = 4.8 days</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> A, B, and C can complete a task in 12, 15, and 20 days, respectively. They start together, but A leaves after 3 days. Find the total time required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <p>A's 3-day work: <b>3/12 = 1/4</b></p>
            <p>Remaining work: <b>3/4</b></p>
            <p>B + C together: <b>1/15 + 1/20 = 7/60</b></p>
            <p>Time required = <b>(3/4) ÷ (7/60) = (3/4) × (60/7) = 6.43 days</b></p>
            <p>Total time = <b>3 + 6.43 = 9.43 days</b></p>
            <p>Answer: <b>9.43 days</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> A and B can complete a work in 10 and 15 days, respectively. How many days will it take if both work together?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <p>A's efficiency = <b>1/10</b>, B’s efficiency = <b>1/15</b></p>
            <p>Total work done per day = <b>1/10 + 1/15 = (3+2)/30 = 5/30 = 1/6</b></p>
            <p>Time = <b>6 days</b></p>
            <p>Answer: <b>6 days</b></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Boats and Streams</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> A boat goes 10 km downstream in 2 hours and returns in 5 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water.</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Speed downstream = 10/2 = 5 km/hr</p>
            <p>Speed upstream = 10/5 = 2 km/hr</p>
            <p>Speed of boat in still water = (5+2)/2 = 3.5 km/hr</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> A person can row 10 km/hr in still water. If the river flows at 3 km/hr, how much time will it take to row 12 km upstream?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Speed upstream = <b>10 - 3 = 7 km/hr</b></p>
        <p>Time = Distance / Speed = <b>12 / 7 = 1.71 hours</b></p>
        <p>Answer: <b>1.71 hours</b></p>
    </div>
</div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> A boat covers 16 km downstream in 2 hours and returns upstream in 4 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Speed downstream = <b>16 / 2 = 8 km/hr</b></p>
        <p>Speed upstream = <b>16 / 4 = 4 km/hr</b></p>
        <p>Speed in still water = <b>(8 + 4) / 2 = 6 km/hr</b></p>
        <p>Answer: <b>6 km/hr</b></p>

        <div class="solution">
            <p>(1/6 + 1/8) = 7/24</p>
            <p>Time = 24/7 ≈ 3.43 hours</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> If an article is sold at 20% profit and its cost price is Rs. 500, find the selling price.</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Profit = 20% of 500 = 100</p>
            <p>Selling Price = 500 + 100 = Rs. 600</p>

    <h2>Simple Interest</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Find the simple interest on Rs. 5000 at 5% per annum for 4 years.</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>SI = (P × R × T) / 100 = (5000 × 5 × 4) / 100 = Rs. 1000</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Compound Interest</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Find the compound interest on Rs. 4000 at 10% per annum for 2 years.</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Amount = 4000(1 + 10/100)^2 = 4000 × 1.21 = Rs. 4840</p>
            <p>Compound Interest = 4840 - 4000 = Rs. 840</p>
        </div>

        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Probability</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> A bag contains 5 red and 3 blue balls. A ball is drawn at random. Find the probability of getting a red ball.</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>Total balls = 5 + 3 = 8</p>
            <p>Probability = 5/8</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> How many times do the hands of a clock overlap in a day?</p>
        <div class="solution">
            <p>The hands overlap once every hour except between 11 and 1.</p>
            <p>So, they overlap 11 times in 12 hours.</p>
            <p>In 24 hours: 11 × 2 = 22 times.</p>
