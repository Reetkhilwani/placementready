    <h1>Data Interpretation Questions & Solutions</h1>
    
    <h2>Bar Graph Analysis</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> The following bar graph shows the sales of a company over five years. If the average sales over these years were 450 units, in which year were the sales below average?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Analyzing the bar graph, we find that the sales in Year 2 and Year 4 were below 450 units.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Pie Chart Interpretation</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> A company's budget distribution is given in a pie chart. If the marketing budget is 20% of the total, and the total budget is $500,000, how much is allocated to marketing?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Marketing budget = 20% of 500,000 = $100,000.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Table-based Data Interpretation</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> The following table shows the production of three factories over five years. If Factory A increased its production by 15% in the last year, what was its new production level?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> If Factory A's previous production was 2000 units, the increase is 15% of 2000 = 300, making the new production 2300 units.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Line Graph Analysis</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            <p><strong>Question 4:</strong> A line graph shows the number of visitors to a museum over six months. If the number of visitors in March was 20% more than in February, and February had 1500 visitors, how many visited in March?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Visitors in March = 1500 + (20% of 1500) = 1800.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Case Study Interpretation</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">

        </div>
        <div class="solution">
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Percentage decrease = ((60 - 50) / 60) Ã— 100 = 16.67%.</p>
